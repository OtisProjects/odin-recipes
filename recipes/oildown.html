    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <strong> <li>Boil the Pigtails</li> </strong>
        <p>Fill a large pot with water, 2 halves of a lemon, and the salted pigtail. Bring the water to a boil, 
        and boil for about 25 minutes. When the timer is done, drain the pigtails. </p>
        <strong><li>Marinate the Chicken</li></strong>
        <p>In a small bowl, combine the 
        chicken and the green seasoning. Cover and set in the fridge. </p>
        <strong><li>Prepare the Coconut Milk</li></strong>
        <p>In a large bowl, whisk the coconut milk with the ground turmeric. 
        If you can find fresh turmeric, blend the turmeric
        and coconut milk in a blender. Set aside.</p>
        <strong><li>Prepare the Oil Down</li></strong>
        <p>Using a very large pot, add chicken (and green seasoning marinade) to the bottom of the pot. 
        Layer the boiled pigtails on top of the chicken. Next, add the prepared breadfruit, green bananas, carrots, pumpkin, and okra. Pour the coconut milk 
        + turmeric combination over the entire contents of the pot. Lastly, put the greens (spinach or callaloo) at the top of the pot. Cover the pot with 
        a lid and cook over medium heat for 25 minutes. Do not stir. </p>
        <strong><li>Make the Dumplings</li></strong>
        <p>When there are about 10 minutes left on the timer, start making the dumplings. To do so, add flour, salt, and water to a small bowl. Knead the combination until a 
        smooth dough forms, that is not sticky but also not dry or crumbly. </p>
        <strong><li>Finish Cooking your Oil Down</li></strong>
        <p>Cover the pot again and allow it to cook for another 30-45 minutes. Do not stir.  </p>
